# Error Debugging from Error Summary

When the user mentions an error or asks for help debugging, read the error summary file at [error_summary.json](mdc:logs/error_summary.json) which contains the 5 most recent errors captured by the logging system.

## Analysis Guidelines

1. **Check timestamps first**: The errors are ordered by recency (newest first). Focus on the most recent error(s) unless the user specifies otherwise.

2. **Determine relevance**: Not all 5 errors may be relevant to the current request. Use these fields to assess relevance:
   - `timestamp`: Is this error recent enough to be related to the current issue?
   - `module`: Does this match the file or module the user is working on?
   - `function`: Does this match the context of what the user is doing?
   - `line_number`: Does this match the area of code being discussed?
   - `message`: Does the error message relate to the user's question?

3. **Prioritize context**: Each error includes `context_lines` showing the 20 log messages leading up to the error. Use these to understand what was happening when the error occurred.

4. **Single vs Multiple errors**: 
   - If the user says "I have an error" (singular), focus on the most recent relevant error
   - Only address multiple errors if the user explicitly mentions multiple issues or if the errors are clearly related

5. **Provide focused solutions**: Once you've identified the relevant error(s), provide a targeted solution rather than trying to fix all logged errors.

## Error Summary Structure

The [error_summary.json](mdc:logs/error_summary.json) file contains:
- `errors`: Array of up to 5 most recent errors
- `latest_error`: Quick reference to the most recent error

Each error entry includes:
- `timestamp`: When the error occurred
- `level`: ERROR or CRITICAL
- `logger_name`: Name of the logger that captured it
- `message`: The error message
- `module`: Python module where error occurred
- `function`: Function where error occurred
- `line_number`: Line number of the error
- `context_lines`: Last 20 log messages before the error
- `traceback`: Full Python traceback (if available)

## Main Log

The complete logging history is available in [main.log](mdc:logs/main.log) if more context is needed beyond the error summary.

## Workflow

1. Read [error_summary.json](mdc:logs/error_summary.json)
2. Analyze the timestamp, module, function, and context to determine which error(s) are relevant
3. Examine the `context_lines` to understand what led to the error
4. Review the `traceback` if available for deeper debugging
5. Read the relevant source file(s) identified in the error
6. Provide a targeted solution for the relevant error(s) only

    "# Data preprocessing: Segment audio files by class\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first step in the data preprocessing pipeline. We break an audio file down into segments (1 second)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook processes long audio recordings (tapes) and their corresponding Audacity label files (TXT format) to extract segments for training an acoustic model. It generates data for two classes:\n",
    "1.  **Target Sounds (Y=1)**: Extracted from time segments explicitly labeled in the Audacity files.\n",
    "2.  **Noise (Y=0)**: Extracted from time segments that *do not* contain labeled sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sliding window approach is used to generate multiple audio clips from both target sound and noise regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "1.  **Configuration**: Define paths to raw audio tapes, label files, and output directories. Set parameters for the sliding window (window size, slide/hop duration).\n",
    "2.  **Parse Labels**: Read Audacity label files to identify time segments where target sounds are present.\n",
    "3.  **Identify Noise Regions**: Determine the time segments in the audio tapes that *do not* contain labeled sounds.\n",
    "4.  **Extract Segments with Sliding Window**:\n",
    "    *   Apply a sliding window to the labeled (target sound) regions to generate positive examples.\n",
    "    *   Apply the same sliding window to the identified noise regions to generate negative examples.\n",
    "5.  **Save Segments**: Save the extracted audio clips as individual WAV files into respective output directories (`anemonefish` for target sounds, `noise` for noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will populate the `anemonefish` and `noise` folders within `data/1_binary_training_data/audio_files/`."
